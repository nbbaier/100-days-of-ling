# 100-days-of-ling

Inspired by the [#100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://github.com/nbbaier/100-days-of-code), I'm setting up a #100DaysOfLinguistics challenge for myself. Setting up this repo as a convenient place to keep a log and version control any ideas I have during this time for myself.

**Daily goal:** work on some linguistics related stuff for at least an hour
