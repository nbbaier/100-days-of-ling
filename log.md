# 100 Days Of Linguistics - Log

### Overall goals
- Get back into the habit of doing linguistics more regularly
- Get work done on the Kabyle project
- Read more papers I want to read

### Day 1: March 4, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Attended Nanosyntax verb group meeting (Abdullah presenting)

### Day 2: March 5, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Read up to section 3 of Starke and Cortiula 2021 "Bearing the Brazilian Cross" on a neat morpheme swap in Brazilian Portuguese verbal inflection. They analyze said swap in nanosyntax.

### Day 3: March 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finish Starke and Cortiula 2021, started reading Bendjaballah and Haiden 2021 "On Berber Verbs of State". Started some reading notes on that paper too. Also did some first transcript of verbs out of Dallet into google sheets.

### Day 4: March 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did more data entry from Dallet's verb dictionary. It's such a cool resource but DAMN do I wish OCR worked on it so I could do this bit faster.

### Day 5: March 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: More Kabyle data entry from Dallet's verb dictionary. Pulled out a couple generalizations and wrote them down so I can think about them as I can go along as well.


### Day 6: March 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Decided to take a different tack with the Kabyle data and started going directly to the patterns of the morphology I'm looking at. Will let me get at higher generalizations faster. Also revived an old pandas script I had to looking at these patterns just to make sure it was working. 

### Day 7: March 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished entering the first chapter of Dallet 1953 and played around with pandas to extract counts of different verb patterns.


### Day 8: March 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Some more data entry and some string of conscious brainstorming about questions I have about the Kabyle patterns I'm finding. 


### Day 9: March 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Some more Kabyle data entry and some analysis with my nascet pandas' script. Need to do some brainstormning about my direction here.


### Day 10: March 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Some more Kabyle data entry, but not that much as I was kid of on a coding kick. Confirmed that I definitely need a concrete goal to keep going on this challege.

### Skip day: March 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Had a bunch of work that needed catching up on, so decided to take this Monday as a skip day and to get back on the ling/coding horse tomorrow!
