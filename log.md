### Day 1: March 4, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Attended Nanosyntax verb group meeting (Abdullah presenting)

### Day 2: March 5, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Read up to section 3 of Starke and Cortiula 2021 "Bearing the Brazilian Cross" on a neat morpheme swap in Brazilian Portuguese verbal inflection. They said swap in nanosyntax. Also took notes on the thing in Dendron, which is satisfying.
